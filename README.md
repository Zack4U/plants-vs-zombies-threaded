## Game Features

### Plants

-   **Peashooter**: Shoots peas that damage zombies. Each pea deals 20 damage.
-   **Sunflower**: Generates sun points every few seconds, which can be used to plant more plants.

### Zombies

-   **Normal Zombie**: A basic zombie with moderate health and slow movement speed.
-   **Zombie Generator**: Spawns zombies at random intervals (10-30 seconds) with configurable probabilities for different zombie types. Currently, only the Normal Zombie is implemented.

### Gameplay

-   **Lanes**: The game consists of 5 lanes where players can plant their defenses.
-   **Tiles**: Each lane is divided into tiles where plants and zombies can be placed.
-   **Projectiles**: Peashooters shoot peas that travel across the lane and damage zombies on impact.
-   **Zombie Behavior**: Zombies move from left to right, eating plants they encounter. If a zombie reaches the end of a lane, the game is over.

### Additional Features

-   **Graphical Interface**: The game uses Java Swing for the graphical interface.
-   **Sun Collection**: Players can collect sun points generated by Sunflowers to plant more defenses.
-   **Zombie Movement and Interaction**: Zombies interact with plants by dealing damage over time until the plant is destroyed.
-   **Projectile System**: Projectiles are managed and rendered dynamically as they move across the screen.
-   **Threaded behavior**: All mechanics are implemented with Runnable library

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd plants-vs-zombies
    ```
3. Build the project using Gradle:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```
4. Run the game:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew run
    ```

## Game Rules

1. **Plant Placement**:

    - Players can place plants on tiles by selecting seeds and clicking on the desired tile.
    - Each plant has a cost in sun points, which must be collected using Sunflowers.

2. **Zombie Interaction**:

    - Zombies move from left to right and attack plants they encounter.
    - If a zombie reaches the end of a lane, the game ends.

3. **Sun Collection**:

    - Sunflowers generate sun points periodically. Collect these points to plant more defenses.

4. **Winning Condition**:
    - Survive the waves of zombies by strategically placing plants to defend your lanes.

## Future Improvements

-   **Additional Zombies**:
    -   Implement more zombie types, such as Conehead Zombie and Buckethead Zombie, with unique abilities and health.
-   **Advanced Plants**:
    -   Add more plant types, such as Wall-nut for stronger defense and Cherry Bomb for area damage.
-   **Game Levels**:
    -   Introduce multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
-   **Sound Effects and Animations**:
    -   Add sound effects for plant actions, zombie attacks, and background music.
-   **Save and Load**:
    -   Implement a save and load system to resume games.
